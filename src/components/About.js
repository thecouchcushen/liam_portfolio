            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Hi There!</h3>
					<p>I'm a lifelong New Yorker: from the burbs all the way to the Finger Lakes and back to Manhattan, I've seen it all.</p>
					<p>I'm a recent grad from Cornell University, where I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering with minors in English and the History of Capitalism (a mouthful, I know). I've always appreciated that Cornell encouraged me to chart my own course and create an interdisciplinary course of study reflecting my diverse interests. Through my engineering coursework I gained deep technical knowledge and mathematical know-how, while the humanities coursework I engaged with helped to keep my oral and written communication skills sharp.</p>
					<p>The technical expertise and communication skills that I developed at Cornell have served me well in my current role as a Business Technology Analyst with Deloitte Consulting, LLP. In this capacity, I have helped architect solutions to some of the most difficult problems that our clients are faced with. But a strong technical background is not enough in any team environment - let alone a client-facing role -  my communication skills have proven to be indispensable.</p>
					<p>In my free time I enjoy kayaking, reading, camping, and failing to live up to my athletic potential (two of my uncles are Olympians)</p>
